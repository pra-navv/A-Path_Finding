## Overview
The A* algorithm is one of the most popular pathfinding algorithms due to its performance and accuracy. This project demonstrates how the A* algorithm works visually, making it easier to understand its step-by-step process.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd astar-pathfinding
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage
Run the script using Python:
```bash
python astar.py
```
This will open a window where you can interactively set the start and end points, place barriers, and see the A* algorithm in action.

## Controls
- **Left Click**: Place the start node, end node, or barriers.
- **Right Click**: Remove a node or barrier.
- **Space**: Start the pathfinding algorithm.
- **C**: Clear the grid and reset the start and end points.
